# Evolution Simulator

This is a simple evolution simulator made in the Godot engine using C#. The
goal of this project is to simulate the evolution of a population of creatures
in a 2D environment. The creatures have a neural network that controls their
behaviors. The creatures have a genome that determines the structure of their
neural network. The creatures can reproduce and pass their genome to their
offspring. The creatures can mutate their genome to introduce variation in the
population.
